                First to say - again - we use in this framework the javascript-framework jquery.<br>
                YOU are able to use another one - due to YOUR needs.<br><br>
                You only have to develop your preferred framework as php-class or do something else.<br>
                Its just on YOU to do or to use what this framework got for you.<br>
                <br>
                Sometimes it is impossible to say what libraries you need for a project.<br>
                So why not install only those you need? - With this framework it is possible<br>
                There is only a basic system with less than 500 Kbyte.<br>
