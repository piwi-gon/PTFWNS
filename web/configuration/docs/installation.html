            There is no installer-script at this time - you have to copy the basic-system to a path where you want to install it.<br>
            <br>
            The main reason why there is no installer is: i got not enough time for now.<br>
            <br>
            The next release will have an installer and you are able to update the framework with the builtin frontend.<br>
            <br>
            There will be a checker for the dependencies too, hopefully.<br>
            <br>
            You are also be able to install modules and extensions.<br>
            These installations are for now not really checking any dependencies but in one of the next releases there will be a check if necessary.<br><br>
            Thats all for now.<br>
            Enjoy the framework and be free to use and extend it ...<br>
