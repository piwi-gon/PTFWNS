                <b>BUT</b> - what if this framework is very much better to handle than any other framework?<br>
                <b>BUT</b> - what if this framework is a framework which you can develop to your own needs?<br>
                <b>BUT</b> - what if you can use other php-libraries like they are in this framework?<br>
                etc... <br>
                <br>
                The main reason why i developed this framework is that there are so many unnecessary overhead and functions which 
                i dont want to use but have to install with some framework so that my project raises to a size which is not rellay
                applicapable to the short project i want to build.<br>
                <br>
                Second i was disappointed to see that every framework i wanted to use could be done only with one project.<br><br>
                <b>THIS</b> framework can be installed everywhere and can be used by more than one project.
                <br><br>
                <b>And more:</b><br><br>
                Let's say you need a barchart-libary in your project.<br><br>
                There are many of them out there which are really useful.<br><br>
                <span style="font-weight:bold;">But</span> - including them in your project could cause a problem with pathes and/or other variables/libraries.<br><br>
                So - wouldn't it be nice to include this library into your normal framework?<br><br>
                With <span style="font-weight:bold;">THIS</span> it can be done in a very simple way.
