            For developing a module you dont have to something special at all.<br>
            <br>
            Just create a class (or more than one) which does the things you want to.<br>
            <br>
            For an extension - buil by you or something that already exists - you can add this to this framework.<br>
            <br>
            The only thing to do is to determine the main-class for the extension to include it.<br>
            <br>
            That's all.
